# Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning: Main Approaches and Models

## Problem

The problem of churn is a problem when a number of individuals move out of a collective group. It is one of the main problems that determine the steady-state level of customers in any type of business.

Recently a large number of customers has left Maastricht Telecom. To address this problem Maastricht Telecom provides customer data to solve two important tasks:
Descriptive task:
 * Characterize loyal and churn customers and propose a focused customer retention program. (This can be done through visualization, descriptive models etc.).
 * Predictive task: Find a model that identifies churn customers. 
 * Select 300 customers using that model from a separate test set and report the number of true churn customers among them.
 * Calculate the expected costs for Maastricht Telecom for one month when using your modelon the test set if every customer predicted as churn willget a gift of 10    euro and every true churn customer predicted as loyal will cause a loss of 64 euros (an average month subscription).
